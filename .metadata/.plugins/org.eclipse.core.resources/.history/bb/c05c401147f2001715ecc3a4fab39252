		Given two strings where first string is a normal string and second string may contain wild card characters. Write a function that returns true if the two strings match. The following are allowed wildcard characters in first string. 
		* --> Matches with 0 or more instances of any character or set of characters.
		? --> Matches with any one character.
		
		Assumptions:
		
		The two strings are both not null.
		Assume there is no more than one '*' adjacent to each other.
		Examples:
		
		input = "abc", pattern = "?*", return true.
